Ravin's Introduction

Problem: in my aerospace work, I had very small sample sizes because we didn't have many rockets.
Frequentist tools weren't helpful.

## How Google uses Bayesian methods:
- Nearly everywhere where there's uncertainty

- https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/overview

## Ravin's tips and advice for how to read the book:
- You don't need to buy the book. It's free online at https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html
- There's 2 parts to the book:
    - Part 1 is the text itself, that's in the printed material
    - Part 2 is extra code notebooks. The full jupyter notebooks are on Part 2
    - https://github.com/BayesianModelingandComputationInPython/BookCode_Edition1 has the full source notebooks 
- There's two ways to read this books
    - Read the text and look at the pictures to work with concepts
    - If you need to be able to use the ideas and run things on your own data, run the code from the book and mess around with the examples. Try it out.
- Programming reference: https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/markdown/chp_11.html#programming-references
- Recommendation: setup the code environment and get the example code running. Learn by doing.
- Focus on Chapters 1-4 together and further chapters are more independent.
- The book is written for pymc3, so use that version of pymc if you need everything to work smoothly. PyMC latest version is 5, right now.

## Our thoughts on the learning plan:
- A slow, deliberate beginning of Chapter 1 and 2.
    - Get the fundamentals right. 
    - Ensure that everyone is more comfortable before moving forward

## Hopes of the group:
- Getting the fundamentals right. 
- Lots of concrete examples.
- Want to see how we can apply these methods to sparse data
- Sharing our experiments and personal projects ()
- Would like to get a deeper understanding of the differences between frequentist and Bayesian approaches. 
- Develop confidence in the material
- Take time for the first two chapters.


## Ravin's suggestions:
- go through chapter 1 and 2 at a reasonable pace.
- then if some of the concepts need explanation, jump over to McElreath's book.
- Don't worry about too much of the theory or the derivations.
- Get an idea of the intuition
- You don't need to understand all the math under the hood.
- Focus on the workflow and concepts more than the theory.
